2.	The superintendent will refuse work that is deemed to be craftwork, i.e. paint by number and predesigned kits. All work must be the artist’s original and rendered by hand. No air brushed, computer generated or mechanically enhanced works will be accepted.  No work that is graphic design or lettering will be accepted.
3.	Work entered must have been completed since the date of the last fair, August 2022, and should not have been previously exhibited.

Glass and plexiglass are acceptable and encouraged, but not required. Judges take matting and framing into account when evaluating all work.
7.	Hanging instructions. Hanging cable must be installed on the backs of the paintings. Screw eyes should be used on the back of the work to hold the wire and be placed about ⅓ of the way down from the top of the frame on each side.
