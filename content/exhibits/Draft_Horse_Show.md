We are very excited to be in our nineteenth year as a North American Classic Six qualifying show.


All draft horses and draft ponies are welcome. We will have Haflinger Classes again this
year. 

Classes will proceed in numerical order beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Friday and 9:30a.m. on Saturday.

Six ribbons will be awarded in each class. 

Stalls will be available after 7 p.m. Thursday. 

Stalls are limited (156) so we cannot offer tack stalls. Stalls will be reserved based on date entries received by the Secretary. A $25.00 per stall deposit is required. $15.00 will be refunded per stall when cleaned and checked. Please call if unable to attend as we do have a limited number of stalls. If stalls fill we will keep a waiting list. Sawdust may or may not be available (depending if it is all gone). Shavings will be available to purchase ahead of time at $5.00 per bag.

Entry Fees are $5.00 per class except as noted. Post entries are double entry fees. No refunds
without a vet certificate. Pre-entries due by August 1, 2022.
